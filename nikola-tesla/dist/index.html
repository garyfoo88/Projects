     Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known for designing the alternating-current (AC) electric system, which is the predominant electrical system used across the world today. He also created the "Tesla coil, " which is still used in radio technology.            </figcaption>

<h3 id="headline">Timeline of Nikola Tesla:</h3>
                           <ul>
                          <p><li><strong>1856</strong> - Nikola Tesla was born in Smiljan, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His parents were ethnic Serbians. His father was an Orthodox Priest, and he credited his mother for his inventiveness.</li></p>
                           <p><li><strong>1875</strong> - In 1875, Tesla began to study engineering at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria. He claimed to have graduated, but the institution disagrees.</li></p>
                           <p><li><strong>1882</strong> - In 1882, he went to work for Continental Edison in Paris. He was attempting to improve on electrical equipment sent from the United States.Working independently, Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle. This is used today in alternators.</li></p>
                           <p><li><strong>1884</strong> - Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, immediately approaching Thomas Edison with a letter of introduction. According to Tesla, he was offered 50,000 dollars to solve a problem, but Edison never paid.</li></p>
                           <p><li><strong>1885</strong> - After Edison refused to pay, Tesla quit working for Edison, with the plan and intention of starting his own electrical company.</li></p>
                           <p><li><strong>1886</strong> - Tesla founded the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company in Rahway, New Jersey. He invented and marketed an arc lamp; however, he earned relatively little off of his investment.</li></p>
                           <p><li><strong>1891</strong> - In 1891, Tesla patented the Tesla Coil. The Tesla Coil is a resonant transformer circuit that produced a high voltage, low current and high frequency alternating current electricity.</li></p>
                           <p><li><strong>1901</strong> - In 1901, construction began on the Wardenclyffe Tower. Tesla believed that he could transmit electrical energy over long distances wirelessly, and the tower would illustrate that. The project was never fully completed.</li></p>
                           <p><li><strong>1915</strong> - On August 4, 1915, Tesla filed suit against Guglielmo Marconi. Marconi is typically credited with radio transmission; however, Tesla accomplished this before Marconi.</li></p>
                           <p><li><strong>1943</strong> - On January 7, 1943, as World War II raged, Nikola Tesla died in the hotel he made his home. Upon his death, the U.S. government immediately seized his papers and research</li></p>
